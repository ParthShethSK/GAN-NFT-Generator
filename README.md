![NFTs](https://github.com/ParthShethSK/GAN-NFT-Generator/assets/75533289/350a5e31-031a-4dbc-81c4-c2c08fc04c40)

Utilizing a lightweight Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) structure inspired by StyleGAN to create unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for the Web3 space.

## Overview

This project focuses on the application of generative AI to the Web3 space, specifically in the creation of NFTs. The implemented GAN structure draws inspiration from StyleGAN, providing a lightweight solution for generating visually appealing and unique NFTs.

## Features

- **GAN Structure:** Lightweight GAN architecture inspired by StyleGAN.
- **Training:** Successfully trained on a dataset of 8000 images for 25000 iterations.
- **NFT Generation:** Users can input a sample image, triggering the generation of a series of NFTs with similar visual characteristics.
- **Web3 Integration:** Explore the possibilities of integrating generated NFTs into the Web3 ecosystem.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- StyleGAN
- Web3

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: lightweight-gan, aim
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `NFT_Generation.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to generate NFTs based on your sample images.

## Training Data

The GAN has been trained on a diverse dataset comprising 8000 images. For details on the dataset and preprocessing, refer to the [CryptoPunks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/cryptopunks).
